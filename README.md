# Eigenlearning

This repo contains code for replicating the experiments of the paper [NTK Eigenvalues Accurately Predict Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03922). The ```.py``` files provide a general codebase for generating synthetic datasets and testing the performance of kernel regression and finite nets learning functions over on the domains of interest. The ```.ipynb``` files contain code for generating the specific figures of the paper.
